# Heart Disease Prediction Using K-Nearest Neighbors

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset used includes various medical parameters to determine whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains 14 features, including age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

## Approach
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Scaling
- Model Training using KNN
- Model Evaluation
- Prediction

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **87.80%** on the training dataset and **89.26%** on the test dataset using 12 neighbours.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or the Python script.
